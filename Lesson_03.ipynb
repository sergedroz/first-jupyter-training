    "This lesson will focus on ransomware and cryptocurrencies to introduce a some basic data science and statistical concepts. We'll look at a campaign called *Deadbolt*, and do some **survival analysis**. This term describes statistical methods that try to determine the duration of certain events. The name derives from biology where a common questions is how long does a population survive after a given event. The obvious question in incident response is how much time does it take from an initial compromise to full encryption. \n",

For example height correlates with weight. A correlation of 0 says the two number do not correlate.\n",
